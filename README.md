# Space giphyAPI

* There are 10 default space-themed buttons.
* Users can add more buttons... which are saved to local storage, so they won't disappear if their browser is refreshed.
* Once custom buttons are created, the user will have the option of deleting all of them or sequentially deleting the most recent ones that were created (one at a time).
* Click on any of the buttons and up to 12 still GIF images will be retrieved through the giphy.com API.
* When the GIFs are clicked, they will toggle back and forth from still to motion.
* The MPAA rating is displayed for each image.
* Clicking on the download button will take you to the full-size animated GIF at giphy.com where you can right-click on it and 'Save image as...'
* If you tick the checkbox below the buttons, subsequent button clicks will add another set of up to 12 GIFs and not just replace the last group.
